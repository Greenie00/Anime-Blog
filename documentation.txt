Do not add forget to add an image field to the articles in their list cards

So I'm having a little issue rendering my rdit page cause i keep getting 
TemplateDoesNotExist error because it keeps loading article)form instead of
article_edit (Hence I'll be renaming article_edit to article form)

I'm also thinking a logo before the Newspaper name like we did in the DebPay project logo

LoginRequiredMixin
The LoginRequiredMixin doesn't seem to be working for now so i'll have to try again
I don't kmow if i set it up right
